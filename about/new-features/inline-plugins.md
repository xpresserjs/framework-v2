# Xpresser Inline Plugins

In the previous version of XpresserJs, plugins are automatically loaded from a defined `plugins.json`.
There was no way to create a plugin without creating a folder and adding it to the `plugins.json`.

In XpresserJs v2, you can create a plugin directly in your code without creating a folder.
And we made it flexible to support the main file of your **file based plugin** can be used as an **inline plugin**.
